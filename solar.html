                <h3 class="heada">>> WHY SOLAR?</h3>
                <h3 class="headb">
                  The benefits of solar power are becoming increasingly evident.
                  Whether it’s to save money or to help the environment,
                  thousands of homeowners and businesses are choosing to invest
                  in solar power.
                </h3>
                <h4 class="headc">Why Solar?</h4>
                <p class="p">
                  Our ultimate source of energy is Sun. The pivotal point of our
                  existence. One that breaks a new dawn every morning. Why the
                  sun radiates to the earth more than 10,000 times the amount of
                  energy that the entire world would consume annually?. Probably
                  because the high and mighty sun knows better that its energy
                  can be used in more ways than how the plants photosynthesized,
                  the animals soaked or the mankind knew. <br />May be the sun
                  understood that many years from its birth, the world would
                  wake up to see the sun as a clean, efficient, bankable and
                  sustainable source of renewable energy. Energy that would be
                  cheaper than any kind of power supply, cleaner with zero CO
                  emissions and accessible to areas where the grid supply could
                  not reach. And in a world battling with energy crisis and
                  global warming, someday, a far-sighted company will herald a
                  revolution and the world would see a million suns rising...
                </p>
                <img src="img/s1.png" />
                <h4 class="headc">Solar Energy</h4>
                <p class="text-base text-para">
                  There is no better source of clean and natural energy than the
                  sun. It radiates more than 10,000 times the amount of energy
                  that the entire world would consume annually. Given its
                  abundance, solar energy can cater to the ever-increasing
                  demand for fuel and make for an efficient source of renewable
                  energy. It is probably the only source of energy that emits no
                  noise while generating power. In addition, it is modular,
                  scalable and highly flexible in nature.<br />
                  In the long run, electricity generated from solar energy
                  systems will be far more cost-effective than any other type of
                  power supply. Not only can power generation become profitable
                  at break-even, despite relatively high initial set-up cost,
                  but solar energy is free from cost escalation.<br />
                  In remote areas such as rural hamlets, forest reserves,
                  environmentally-sensitive areas and national parks where grid
                  supply is not available, off-grid standalone and home lighting
                  systems often serve as a lifeline. Technology development has
                  enabled solar energy systems to supply power 24x7.<br />
                  Kaihatsu Solar aims to power Indian communities by providing
                  clean and cost-effective solar electricity, and is committed
                  to achieving grid parity by 2017. Kaihatsu Solar is also
                  working to reduce the cost of setting up solar energy systems
                  for bulk power generation.

                  Silicon and thin Film CIGS.The first one is a well established
                  technology in market so there is a large market demand.
                  However the cost and availability of Silicon as raw material
                  has forced the market to move on making a solar cell other
                  than Silicon. Thus CIGS is an emerging technology now

                  very high after 10 years when the plant becomes debt free. The
                  plant life is 30 years and with no need for raw material it is

                      <strong>Advantages :</strong>
                      Rather than giving the free electricity to farmers, they
                      can be given dish through financial agencies like NABARD.
                      This will remove the burden on utility companies. NABARD
                      can earn interest and carbon credits.
