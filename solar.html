                            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#081242]">The benefits of solar power are becoming
                                increasingly evident. Whether it’s to save money or to help the environment, thousands
                                of homeowners and businesses are choosing to invest in solar power.</h3>
                            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#081242]">Why Solar?</h4>
                            <p class="text-base text-gray-500 ">Our ultimate source of energy is Sun. The pivotal point
                                of our existence. One that breaks a new dawn every morning. Why the sun radiates to the
                                earth more than 10,000 times the amount of energy that the entire world would consume
                                annually?. Probably because the high and mighty sun knows better that its energy can be
                                used in more ways than how the plants photosynthesized, the animals soaked or the
                                mankind knew. <br>May be the sun understood that many years from its birth, the world
                                would wake up to see the sun as a clean, efficient, bankable and sustainable source of
                                renewable energy. Energy that would be cheaper than any kind of power supply, cleaner
                                with zero CO emissions and accessible to areas where the grid supply could not reach.
                                And in a world battling with energy crisis and global warming, someday, a far-sighted
                                company will herald a revolution and the world would see a million suns rising...</p>
                            <img src="img/s1.png">
                            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#081242]">Solar Energy</h4>
                            <p class="text-base text-gray-500 ">There is no better source of clean and natural energy
                                than the sun. It radiates more than 10,000 times the amount of energy that the entire
                                world would consume annually. Given its abundance, solar energy can cater to the
                                ever-increasing demand for fuel and make for an efficient source of renewable energy. It
                                is probably the only source of energy that emits no noise while generating power. In
                                addition, it is modular, scalable and highly flexible in nature.<br>
                                In the long run, electricity generated from solar energy systems will be far more
                                cost-effective than any other type of power supply. Not only can power generation become
                                profitable at break-even, despite relatively high initial set-up cost, but solar energy
                                is free from cost escalation.</br>
                                In remote areas such as rural hamlets, forest reserves, environmentally-sensitive areas
                                and national parks where grid supply is not available, off-grid standalone and home
                                lighting systems often serve as a lifeline. Technology development has enabled solar
                                energy systems to supply power 24x7.</br>
                                Kaihatsu Solar aims to power Indian communities by providing clean and cost-effective
                                solar electricity, and is committed to achieving grid parity by 2017. Kaihatsu Solar is
                                also working to reduce the cost of setting up solar energy systems for bulk power

                                A thermic fluid is heated using mirrors and solar
                                energy. This fluid makes a steam. This steam can be use to generate the power using
                                normal steam generator.

                                        with alternate fuel. Unlike PV, the efficiency increases with the heat.Hence
                                        ideally suited for India.
